# ForFun 

ForFun is a repository where I've placed some side projects I've done in the
past for no other reason than friends and fooling around. 



## How It Works

1. Secret Santas is different bots which can send messages to other people in a 
   notifying them who their secret santas are via facebook messenger in `secret-santa.py`
2. onlineJudge is a online ACM coding competition practice questions I've completed.
4. 40ksheets is a website I made to convert HTML datasheets and make them readable
5. MQleapImagineThat is a side project I did for Macquarie University to help kids decide whats jobs they wanted to do in the future.
