# How to use

Firstly you'll need to use some sort of editor like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) to open your HTML.

1. Generate the HTML from Battlescribe for your army sheet

2. Copy in the styling from the `Blood_Angels.html` into you html document between the `<style>` ```copy this stuff ``` `</style>`

3. Paste it into your own html document inbetween the `<style>` tags.
4. Save and enjoy your actually readable war notes
