# The Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make Battlescribe 40k datasheets more readable.
It removes the style tags in the HTML file generated by Battlescribe and replaces it with the style for 
the specific layout the user wants. 

Then that file is downloadable and the user can print out there sheets or view them in a browser. 

The site is fully responsive and fast to comply with Google lighthouse requirements.
